## Pre-requisites:

- Node.js

## Run App Locally

In the root project directory run commands:

`npm install`

then cd into client directory

`cd client/`

then run

`npm install`

That will ensure that you have all of the necessary dependencies.

After that go back to the root project directory and run

`npm run dev`

that command will start up both frontend and backend server.
